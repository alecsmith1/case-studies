In 2016, the fictional bike-share company Cyclistic launched and has since grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles accessible via a network of 692 stations across Chicago.

In its early years, Cyclistic has grown via marketing geared toward general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. Thanks to its offering of flexible price plans (single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships), the broad marketing efforts brought in a large customer-base.

### Scenario

Finance analysts at Cyclistic have come to understand that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders (non-members who use single-ride or full-day passes). As such, they believe the key to future growth can be found in maximizing annual membership.

Lily Moreno, the director of marketing, believes there's solid opportunity to convert casual riders into members. Since casual riders are already aware of Cyclistic's convenience and accessibility, she believes a marketing campaign aimed at converting casual riders into annual members would help drive future growth.
