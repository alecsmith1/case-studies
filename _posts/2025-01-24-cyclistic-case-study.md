## **About The Company**

- **Company –** Cyclistic - fictional Chicago bike share company
- **Offering –** single-ride passes, full-day passes, annual memberships
- **Fleet –** 5,824 bikes across 692 stations

<br />

## **Company Status**

**Profitability Assessment –** <br />
Finance analysts found that annual members are much more profitable than single-ride or day-pass casual riders. 

**Historical Marketing –** <br />
Cyclistic's marketing up to now has been geared toward general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments.

**Hypothesis –** <br />
Lily Moreno (Director of Marketing) believes there's opportunity to convert casual riders into members and that a marketing campaign aimed at converting casual riders into annual members would help drive future growth

<br />

## **Defining The Problem**

Analyze Cyclistic historical bike trip data to understand how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently.

**Key Stakeholders –**
- Lily Moreno – the director of marketing (my manager)
